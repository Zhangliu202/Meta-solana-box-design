# Terms of Service

Welcome to Meta Solana Bot, an application (the "Bot" or "App") provided by MetaTradingBot ("we," "our," or "us"). The Bot grants access to a decentralized protocol on the Solana blockchain, enabling users to trade compatible digital assets ("Meta Solana Bot," or the "MetaTradingBot"). The Bot is one means, but not the only way, to access the Protocol. To use the Bot, you must utilize Telegram software. Your relationship with Telegram is governed by their applicable terms of service, not by this Terms of Service Agreement (the "Agreement").

This Agreement outlines the terms and conditions for accessing and using the Bot. Please read this Agreement carefully. By accessing or using the Bot, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree, you are not authorized to access or use the Bot and should discontinue its use immediately.

Additionally, you represent that you and your financial institutions, or any entity owning or controlling you or your financial institutions, are (1) not subject to sanctions or listed on any prohibited or restricted parties list, including but not limited to those maintained by the United Nations Security Council, the U.S. Government (e.g., the Specially Designated Nationals List and Foreign Sanctions Evaders List of the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Entity List of the U.S. Department of Commerce), the European Union or its Member States, the United Kingdom, or any other relevant government authority, and (2) not located in any country subject to a comprehensive sanctions program implemented by the United States.

### Modification

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify this Agreement periodically. If any modifications are made, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of the Agreement and by maintaining the current version at MetaView's terms of services. All modifications will be effective when posted, and your continued access or use of the Bot will confirm your acceptance of those changes. If you do not agree with any modifications to this Agreement, you must immediately stop accessing and using the Bot.

### Eligibility

To access or use the Bot, you must be legally capable of entering into a binding contract with us. Thus, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction (e.g., 18 years old in the United States) and have the full right, power, and authority to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and any company or legal entity for which you may access or use the Bot.

You further represent that you are not (a) the subject of economic or trade sanctions administered or enforced by any governmental authority or otherwise listed on any prohibited or restricted parties list (including but not limited to the list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury) or (b) a citizen, resident, or organized in a jurisdiction or territory subject to comprehensive country-wide, territory-wide, or regional economic sanctions by the United States.

Finally, you represent that your access and use of the Bot will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations and that you will not use the Bot to conduct, promote, or facilitate any illegal activity.

### Proprietary Rights

We own all intellectual property and other rights in the Bot and its contents, including (but not limited to) software, text, images, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, and designs. This intellectual property is available under the terms of our copyright licenses and our Trademark Guidelines.

### Additional Rights

We reserve the following rights, which do not constitute our obligations: (a) to modify, substitute, eliminate, or add to the Bot without notice to you; (b) to review, modify, filter, disable, delete, and remove any content and information from the Bot; and (c) to cooperate with any law enforcement, court, or government investigation or order or third party requesting or directing that we disclose information or content or information that you provide.

### Privacy

When you use the Bot, the only information we collect is your blockchain wallet address, completed transaction hashes, and token names and symbols. We do not collect personal information (e.g., your name or other identifiers linked to you). However, we use third-party service providers that may receive or independently obtain your personal information from publicly available sources. We do not control how these third parties handle your data, and you should review their privacy policies to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information. By accessing and using the Bot, you consent to our data practices and our service providers' treatment of your information.

We use the information we collect to detect, prevent, and mitigate financial crime and other illicit activities on the Bot. For these purposes, we may share the information with blockchain analytics providers. We share information with these service providers only to help us ensure the safety, security, and integrity of the Bot. Please note that when you use the Bot, you are interacting with the Solana blockchain, which may inherently provide transparency into your transactions. MetaView does not control and is not responsible for any information you make public on blockchains by taking actions through the Bot.

### Prohibited Activity

You agree not to engage in, or attempt to engage in, any of the following prohibited activities regarding your access and use of the Bot:

_Intellectual Property Infringement_. Activities that infringe on or violate any copyright, trademark, service mark, patent, right of publicity, right of privacy, or other proprietary or intellectual property rights under the law. _Cyberattack_. Activities that seek to interfere with or compromise the integrity, security, or proper functioning of any computer, server, network, personal device, or other information technology system, including (but not limited to) deploying viruses and denial of service attacks. _Fraud and Misrepresentation_. Activities that seek to defraud us or any other person or entity, including (but not limited to) providing false, inaccurate, or misleading information to unlawfully obtain another's property. _Market Manipulation_. Activities that violate any applicable law, rule, or regulation concerning the integrity of trading markets, including (but not limited to) manipulative tactics such as “rug pulls,” pumping and dumping, and wash trading. _Securities and Derivatives Violations_. Activities that violate any applicable law, rule, or regulation concerning the trading of securities or derivatives, including (but not limited to) unregistered securities offerings and the offering of leveraged and margined commodity products to retail customers in the United States. _Any Other Unlawful Conduct_. Activities that violate any applicable law, rule, or regulation of the United States or another relevant jurisdiction, including (but not limited to) the restrictions and regulatory requirements imposed by U.S. law.

### Not Registered with the SEC or Any Other Agency

We are not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a national securities exchange or in any other capacity.

### Non-Solicitation; No Investment Advice

You agree and understand that: (a) all trades you submit through the Bot are unsolicited, meaning they are solely initiated by you; (b) you have not received any investment advice from us regarding any trades.

### Security

9.1. Your responsibility: You are responsible for taking appropriate action to protect your hardware and data from viruses, malicious software, and any inappropriate material. We are not responsible for any claims or losses resulting from your failure to comply with this clause.

9.2. Security measures: At all times, you and any Permitted Users shall maintain adequate security and control of all your Accounts. You are responsible for taking necessary security measures (or ensuring that your Permitted Users take such measures) to protect your Account.

9.3 Private Key: To avoid possible loss of funds, ensure no one else sees or can capture a screenshot while you retrieve your private key. Many phishing campaigns ask for your private key to gain access to your account. You should never share your private key with anyone, including the MetaView team. We will not be responsible for any loss of funds if you import your private key to other apps.

### Compliance and Tax Obligations

The Bot may not be available or appropriate for use in your jurisdiction. By accessing or using the Bot, you agree that you are solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Specifically, your use of the Bot may result in various tax consequences, such as income or capital gains tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, or sales tax in certain jurisdictions. It is your responsibility to determine whether taxes apply to any transactions you initiate or receive and, if so, to report and/or remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.

### Assumption of Risk

By accessing and using the Interface, you represent that you are financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital assets such as SOL, stablecoins, and other digital tokens like those following the Solana Token Standard.

In particular, you understand that the markets for these digital assets are nascent and highly volatile due to risk factors, including but not limited to adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You acknowledge that anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade such tokens. So-called stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be, may not be fully or adequately collateralized, and may be subject to panics and runs.

Further, you understand that smart contract transactions automatically execute and settle and that blockchain-based transactions are irreversible once confirmed. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems like Solana are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and accept the risk of selecting to trade in Expert Modes, which can expose you to potentially significant price slippage and higher costs.

In summary, you acknowledge
