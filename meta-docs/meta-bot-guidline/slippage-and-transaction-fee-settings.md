# â›½ Slippage and Transaction Fee Settings

## I. Slippage

Slippage is the difference between the expected price at the time of order placement and the actual price when the order is executed. Slippage is applied individually to each type of transaction, whether buying, selling, or sniping. You need to set the slippage value for each trading activity.

_Note: The slippage percentage can affect your trading performance, so you need to calculate and set a slippage percentage that is suitable for you._

## II. Gas free

In the <mark style="color:blue;">/setting</mark> section, Choose the transaction fee for each of your buy, sell, and snipe activities. If you set the gas fee to auto mode, the Meta Solana bot will automatically adjust the gas price based on current market conditions. You should carefully check before confirming the transaction, especially in situations where transaction fees may spike.
