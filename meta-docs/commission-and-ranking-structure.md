# Commission and Ranking Structure

### I. Concepts:

1. **Commission Levels**
2. **Bot Ranks**

### II. What are Commission Levels?

Commission Levels determine the percentage payouts based on the hierarchy of registered referral links. Levels are structured from top to bottom:

* F0, F1, F2, F3, ...
* Example: John starts as F0. If John refers Mary (who becomes John's F1), and Mary generates a transaction, John earns 30% of Mary's transaction fee. This hierarchy can extend infinitely based on the number of referrals.

### III. What are Bot Ranks?

Bot Ranks are titles awarded based on transaction volume within a member's network. Achieving a rank allows members to earn additional percentages from transaction fees generated by all members in their network (from F1 to Fn).

### IV. Rank Differences:

For example, if members in a network reach higher ranks:

* Same rank: No additional earnings.
* Higher rank: No additional earnings.
* Lower rank: Earns the percentage difference between their rank and the lower-ranked member's rank.

### V. Mechanism:

* **Commission Levels:** F1 = 30%, F2 - Fn = 0% (if not ranked)
* **Rank-based Commission:**
  * Rank 1: 10% of system-wide fees
  * Rank 2: 15% of system-wide fees
  * Rank 3: 20% of system-wide fees
  * Rank 4: 25% of system-wide fees
  * Rank 5: 30% of system-wide fees

### VI. Level-based Commission Mechanism:

* Lower level: Earns the percentage difference between the higher level and the lower level.
* Same level and equal level: No additional earnings.

### VII. Ranking Conditions:

* **Rank 1:** Requires 1,000 transaction volumes per week
* **Rank 2:** Requires 5,000 transaction volumes per week
* **Rank 3:** Requires 20,000 transaction volumes per week
* **Rank 4:** Requires 50,000 transaction volumes per week
* **Rank 5:** Requires 100,000 transaction volumes per week

### VIII. Monthly Bonuses:

* Maintain Rank 1: $300
* Maintain Rank 2: $800
* Maintain Rank 3: $1,500
* Maintain Rank 4: $3,000
* Maintain Rank 5: $10,000
